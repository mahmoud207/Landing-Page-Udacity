# Landing-Page-Udacity

I AM Very Happy to Finish my First Project
and Hope to Pass Through Successfully
I Used All the Tools I Learned in The Course,
and I Fulfilled All The Requirements you Asked me in The Project.

 1- I Added Section Number 4 in HTML

 2- I Create Navbar and Li Items by JavaScript

 3- I Made Function for the Active Stats and I Used getBoundingClientRect() and if Condition for both section and navlist

 4- I Made the navList Disappear After 4.2 Seconds
 
 5- For Smooth Scrolling I Made it by scrollIntoView by Clicking on the Element Using addEventListener
